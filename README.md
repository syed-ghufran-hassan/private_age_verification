 This project provides a decentralized solution for verifying an individual's age using blockchain technology. The application allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet, input their age, and compare it against a predefined threshold age. The contract then verifies whether the user meets the age requirement and displays the result on the frontend. It utilizes zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) for privacy-preserving age verification, ensuring that the user's age is validated without revealing any personal data.

The solution is designed to be secure, private, and transparent, leveraging the power of smart contracts to handle age verification in a trustless environment. The project also includes wallet connection functionality, allowing seamless interaction with blockchain networks.
